October 2: Added first scraper set to scrape a known classroom site designed for scraping. Original files and tutorial found here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/web-scraping-python-tutorial-how-to-scrape-data-from-a-website/

Initial scraper uses beautifulsoup: https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/
